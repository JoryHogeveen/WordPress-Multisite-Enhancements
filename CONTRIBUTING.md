# Getting Started
* Make sure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free).
* See if your issue has been discussed (or even fixed) earlier. You can [search for existing issues](https://github.com/bueltge/wordpress-multisite-enhancements/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue).

	* Clearly describe the issue including steps to reproduce when it is a bug.
	* Make sure you fill in the earliest version that you know has the issue.
* Fork the repository on GitHub.

# Making Changes
* Create a topic branch from where you want to base your work.
	* This is usually the `master` branch.
	* Only target release branches if you are certain your fix must be on that branch.
	* To quickly create a topic branch based on the `master` branch:
	    * `git checkout -b issue/%YOUR-ISSUE-NUMBER%_%DESCRIPTIVE-TITLE% master`
	* Please avoid working directly on the `master` branch.
* Make commits of logical units.
* Make sure your commit messages are helpful.
