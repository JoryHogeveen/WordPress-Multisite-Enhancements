    - php

# Versions of PHP to test against
php:
  - 5.3.3
  - 5.3
  - 5.4
  - 5.5
  - 5.6
  - 7.0
  - hhvm
  - nightly

# Specify versions of WordPress to test against
# WP_VERSION = WordPress version number (use "master" for SVN trunk)
# WP_MULTISITE = whether to test multisite (use either "0" or "1")
env:
    - WP_VERSION=master WP_MULTISITE=1

# Next we define our matrix of additional build configurations to test against.
# The versions listed above will automatically create our first configuration,
# so it doesn't need to be re-defined below.

# WP_VERSION specifies the tag to use. The way these tests are configured to run
# requires at least WordPress 4.0.0 Specify "master" to test against SVN trunk.

# Note that Travis CI supports listing these above to automatically build a
# matrix of configurations, but we're being nice here by manually building a
# total of four configurations even though we're testing 4 versions of PHP
# along with 2 versions of WordPress (which would build 8 configs otherwise).
# This takes half as long to run while still providing adequate coverage.
